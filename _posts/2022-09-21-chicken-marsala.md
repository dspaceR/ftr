    1. Pound the chicken until each breast is about 1/4 inch thick.  Trim flattened chicken into thirds. Set aside
    2. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a medium or large saucepan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and saute for 10-15 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from pan and set aside.
    3. Combine the flour, seasoning, and salt and pepper in a shallow bowl. Toss the chicken in the flour mixture until coated. Shake off excess.
    4.  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Pan-fry the coated chicken for a few minutes on each side, until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.
    5. Add the mushrooms back to the pan on medium high heat.
    6. Add the garlic and wine or broth - If using wine, let the mixture simmer gently to reduce by half, stirring occasionally. After 10-15 minutes, add the cornstarch, cream, and salt to the sauce mixture - it should start to thicken slightly.
    7. Add Chicken back into sauce and mushrooms. Top with tomatoes and simmer until the tomatoes have softened a bit. Serve with fresh parsley and over potatoes or noodles.
    **ProTips**
    1. This is such an easy fresh recipe. You can also make this ahead in a crockpot in a pinch, though it's better on the stove top. Add chicken, mushrooms, garlic and 1/2 cup of beef stock to the crockpot and cook on low for 5 hours. later add the heavy cream, tomatoes and a few TBS of marsala or sherry. Add cornstartch and a bit off beef stock mixed; into the pot a;nd stir to thicken a bit.  
    2. I like my tomatoes under roasted and just ready to burst so I don't like them in for too long.  If you like yours softer, put them in for longer.
