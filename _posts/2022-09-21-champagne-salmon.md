    **ProTip**
    1. The important part of this recipe is to balance the flavor of the champagne liquid and the heavy cream.  Too much cream and it will be a little bland, too much broth and it’ll be too champagne-y.  The key is to taste and taste.  Once you get a handle on the mixture, you’ll be able to make this recipe a million times and always get it right.

Sounds decadent doesn’t it?  So one night I was going to make my Nane’s pasta with clam sauce, but I only had salmon.  Then someone came over with a bottle of champagne.  I thought, “mmm…can I find a recipe that fits all three?”  The answer was, “with a little combination-yes”.  So here’s the recipe, taken from a HG-TV recipe, a Food Network Recipe and my Nane’s recipe.
