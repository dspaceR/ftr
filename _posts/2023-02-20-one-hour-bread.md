    1. Heat oven to 450.
    2. In a small bowl combine warm water (105-110 degrees), sugar and yeast. Give a quick stir.
    3. Leave the bowl for 5 min to bloom.  If the yeast does not bubble, toss it out and start over.
    4. Pour the mixture into a stand mixer bowl fitted with a dough hook.
    5. Add salt, softened butter and 1 cup of flour. With a rubber spatula, mix until wet.
    6. Using the dough hook on Medium speed continue to mix in 2 more cups of flour a bit at a time. You should now be at 3 cups total.
    7. Add in the last of the flour 1/3 at a time to see how much you need. The dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl but still be slightly sticky. I usually end up needing to add the full last cup.
    8. Turn the dough hook to medium high and have the machine knead for 6-10 min. You'll know the dough is done when it is smooth and elastic and passes the windowpane test.
    9. Line a baking sheet with parchment.
    10. Dump dough out of the machine and shape into a large loaf about 12" - 14" in length.
    11. Use a sharp knife to make 3-4 slits on top.
    12. Cover with a tea towel and leave in a warm (but not hot) place fore 20 min to rise.
    13. When the dough is doubled in size, use a fork to whip up the egg white and brush on if desired.
    14. Put bread in the oven uncovered and bake for about 20 min.  Bread is done when the top is golden and the bottom browned and hollow sounding when you knock. When in doubt, check for temp between 190–210° in multiple places.

    **ProTips**
    1. Bread takes practice, quick bread has even more of a chance to get screwed up.  Good news is, bread is bread and is usually pretty good unless undercooked or completely burned. It's a low bar once you put butter on it or dip it in a hearty stew.

Legit: the [Food Charlatan](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/one-hour-french-bread-recipe/) saved my life one night when I had a bread emergency.  This is almost that recipe but with a few changes so I can remember what I did to make such great, last-minute, bread.
