    **ProTips**
    1. This is a really simple meal with simple ingredients so quality is key. Splurge for a good balsamic or a rich dijon. It'll be worth it I swear.
    2. I like my tomatoes under roasted and just ready to burst so I don't like them in for too long.  If you like yours roasted, put them in with the onions.
