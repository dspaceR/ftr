    **ProTips**

    You can make this the night before christmas up to step 11.  I store it in the fridge covered in foil overnight.  In the morning take it out and let it come to room temperature then top with the canned filling of your choice.

This is a family tradition.  We make it every christmas eve.  Without fail.  For 60 years. I usually make a blueberry and a cherry one.
