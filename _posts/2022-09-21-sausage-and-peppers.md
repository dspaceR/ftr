    **ProTip**

    The thing about this recipe is it’s easy to customize.  We like it spicy so I always throw in some crushed red pepper flakes and serve either with pasta or a really good french bread.  You can also go with sweeter and add fresh basil leaves and use a tomato vodka sauce with fresh tomatoes diced and added in.  This way is good with pasta, I like a Manicotti or a Gemelli.

Sounds decadent doesn’t it?  So one night I was going to make my Nane’s pasta with clam sauce, but I only had salmon.  Then someone came over with a bottle of champagne.  I thought, “mmm…can I find a recipe that fits all three?”  The answer was, “with a little combination-yes”.  So here’s the recipe, taken from a HG-TV recipe, a Food Network Recipe and my Nane’s recipe.
