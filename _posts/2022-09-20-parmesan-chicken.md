    1. Preheat oven to 450°F.
    2. In a bowl, combine the minced garlic with the butter. Microwave until butter is melted.  
    3. In another bowl mix together the bread crumbs, Parmesan, salt, and pepper. 
    4. Dip chicken pieces into garlic butter, then into crumb mixture to coat.
    5. Place coated chicken pieces on to a 9×13 baking dish. Try to leave a little room between each piece. 
    6. Drizzle with remaining garlic butter and bake uncovered 15 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Note that the chicken will get much more browned on the bottom side than on the top.
    7. Serve over pasta with sauce or with just the drippings drizzled over.
