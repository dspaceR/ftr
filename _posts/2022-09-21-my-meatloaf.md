    **ProTips**
    
    1. The curry is the secret ingredient. It adds a warmth to the meatloaf that's so good.  Try it as written above and then adjust the amount to your liking.  I usually double it.
    2. The sauce is sooo good and this recipe makes a lot.  You should have enough to baste 3-4 times and then some for on top.
    3. Who has instant coffee these days!? I never do so I just use a tsp of coffee cold and left over from my morning pot. Works just as well.
