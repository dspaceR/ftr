    **Follow This Recipe**
    1.  Make sure your oven rack is in the middle of your oven so you have room and preheat the oven to 450°.  
    2. In a big bowl combine the garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper, Panko crumbs and mix well.
    3. Prepare your rack of lamb (if packaged in plastic) by removing any residual liquid with a paper towel (If you got your chops from butcher they should be dry enough).
    4.  Sprinkle salt and pepper onto all sides of the lamb and rub in. Set aside.
    5. Prepare the skillet on the stove on high heat with 2 tbs of oil.  When pan and oil are hot begin searing each side of the lamb rack.  You want to give it 1 min. or 2 min on each side or until it is a nice carmel-y color.  Don’t forget to sear the ends.
    6. After searing, brush the rack of lamb with the mustard on all sides and roll it in your mixed breadcrumb mixture.  Rack should be evenly coated up to the bones.
    7. Place rack in the glass pan, bones side down.  Use a small bit of foil to cover each bone end.
    8. Place the lamb in the oven for 13-19 minutes depending on how done you want it. A thermometer is crucial. If you have a thermometer, taking it to 120° rare should end up Med-rare after resting which is how I like it. 
    9. When done baking let the meat rest 5 min under a foil tent before cutting and serving. 

    **ProTips**
    
    1. The searing pan should be very hot and the oil should be glassy. You don't want to have to leave the lamb on for too long for it to carmelize
    2. The foil on the ends of the bones helps keep the meat tender and not loose so much heat when baking, don't skip this step.
    3. Fresh rosemary is the best for this recipe but dried can be used if you're in a jam.
