    **ProTip**
    To complete the “sushi restaruant” taste this meal has to have steamed edemame as a side dish. There are tons of varieties that you can get from the frozen food section at the grocery store. Also I always use a sake in the dish that I can drink with dinner.

I like sweet fish. I make a great pineapple salmon as well, but this is by far my favorite salmon recipe. Why? Because it’s like having a whole sushi dinner in your mouth at once. Delicious.
