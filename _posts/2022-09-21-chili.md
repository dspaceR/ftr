    **ProTip**
    1. This is the easiest recipe, the key is to make it and try it as it cooks.  As Kevin from The Office said, the ingredients "will get to know each other in the pot". The longer it simmers the more flavorful.
    2. This is also easy for the crockpot. I still like to brown my meat a little in advance but then I throw that in with all the rest and just leave it on low for 6 hours or high for 3.
