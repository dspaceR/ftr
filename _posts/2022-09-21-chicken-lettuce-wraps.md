    **ProTips**
    1. Prechopping will save you time and overcooking in the long run.  I have a hand chopper and it makes things quick and easy.
    2. This can also be made with tofu instead of chicken using these directions for the tofu: Press the water out of the tofu with paper towels or a press. Fry the tofu as you would the chicken by crumbling the tofu into the pan, breaking it into very small pieces as it cooks. Continue cooking for 5 minutes.
    3. I make rice as a side and to turn this meal from an appetizer into an entree.
    4. Instead of red pepper flakes, siracha is a great spicy add in.
