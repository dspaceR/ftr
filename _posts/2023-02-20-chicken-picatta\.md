    1. If you're using full size chicken breasts you must first tenderize the meat by placing it in a bag or under cling film and pounding it with the flat side of a tenderizing hammer until the breasts are 1/4" thick. If you are using thin sliced breasts you can skip to step 2.   
    2. Cut each pounded breast into 1/2 or 1/3's 
    3. Season the pounded chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. Roll each piece in the flour.
    4. In a high sided, large pan heat olive oil and 1 tbs of butter on med-high heat. Lay chicken in the hot oil/butter and cook about 4 min on either side or until a quick thermometer reads 165ยบ.
    5. Put the chicken aside.
    6. In the same pan, lower heat to medium and add 3 tbs butter. Add mushrooms and a bit of salt. Cook mushrooms until golden brown and reduced in size. 
    7. Put mushrooms aside.
    8. In the pan, turn the heat back to med-high and deglaze the pan with the the 1/4 cup white wine or chicken stock.
    9. Add remaining 3 tbsp of butter, garlic and lemon juice to the pan.
    10. When the butter is melted in, add in the capers, heavy cream and parmesan cheese. Stir well until the mixture starts to bubble and thickens.
    11. Place the mushrooms and chicken back in the pan. Baste the chicken with some of the sauce and lower the temperature.
    12. Serve over pasta or mashed potatoes with fresh parsley.

    **Protip**
    1. It's really important that your chicken is fresh or FULLY defrosted.  If you really want the chicken to melt in your mouth. Pound and season the breasts with salt and pepper and leave on the counter for at least an hour before cooking.
    2. Not a huge fan of alchohol? The chicken stock is the best alternitave to the white wine. Even if you don't mind the alcohol but want a little extra sauce (I like mine saucy) add in BOTH the white wine and the stock.
    3. I add a tsp of the caper juice directly to the sauce.
    4. Add the cream in slowly and stir while you do it. Hot liquid and heavy cream will curdle if you add too much too fast.

Chicken Picatta is a coveted dish in our family. One of the first my new husband requested after saying that a friend's girlfriend had made the best picatta he had ever had. Well I took that as a challenge and this is the closest I've gotten to the best.  It's pretty close to a cheesecake restaruant's Chicken Picatta.
