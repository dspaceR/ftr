    * 1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
    * 2. Dice chicken and onion and 1/4 cup of sauce in a pan. 
    * 3. Saute until cooked. Set aside in a bowl.
    * 4. Open black beans, cheese, chilies and enchillada sauce and set to the side by the chicken.
    * 5. Prepare a 9x13 pyrex or pan by placing it next to the stove and near the other ingredients.
    * 6. Prepare the tortillas. Heat a small light skillet on med-high heat. Add a teaspoon of oil (high smoke point oil as indicated above, we use grapeseed oil) to coat the pan. 
    * 7. Dip a tortilla in the sauce to coat the tortilla with sauce on both sides. Place the tortilla in the skillet and heat for a few seconds, until the tortilla gets warm. Use a spatula to flip to the other side for a few more seconds.
    * 8. Lay the tortilla in the pan. Place a couple spoonfuls of the chicken mixture in the center of a tortilla, add some cheese, chilies and beans and roll it up. DO THIS IN THE PAN. 
    * 9. Repeat steps 7 & 8 until all of your tortillas are neatly placed in rows in the casserole dish. 
    * 10. Cover the tortillas rolls with the remaining sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining grated cheese.
    * 11. Cover in foil and place in the oven and cook for 20 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly.
    * 12. Remove foil and bake for 10 more minutes
    * 13. Let cool for 10 min before serving.
    **Protips**
    * 1. This is gonna be messy. Read step 7 carefullly before you start. I don't even use a spatula at this point and just pinch the tortilla between my forefinger and thumb and flip after a few seconds. -- This is dangerous, I don't suggest it...I'm just telling you, that's what I do. Use whatever works best for you.
    * These are chicken enchilladas but as with most mexican food, the protein is negotiable and I have used, just beans, carnitas, steak and even tofu before. All good.
