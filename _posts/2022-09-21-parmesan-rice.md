    **Follow This Recipe**
    1. Use large, deep skillet or a large sauce pan.
    2. Add chicken broth, uncooked rice, 1/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to boil. 
    3. Mix in tomatoes, basil and cheese. Reduce the heat to simmer. Cover the skillet with the lid. 
    4. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, covered, on low boiling simmer; until the rice is cooked through. 
    5. If the rice absorbs all of the broth but is still tough, add about 1/2 cup water to the rice
    6. Fluff and mix the rice and serve

    **ProTips**
    1. In a pinch I can make this with minute rice. Just follow the instructions on the package using broth to subsittue for water.
