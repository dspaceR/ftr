    1. Make dough
    2. In medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa, and cinnamon.
    3. Using fingertips or pastry blender, blend in butter just until mixture resembles coarse meal. (Alternatively, pulse in food processor.) 
    4. Drizzle limoncillo over mixture and gently stir with fork until incorporated.
    5. Turn out dough onto sheet of plastic wrap. (Dough will still look somewhat dry and crumbly.)
    6. Gather together into ball, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate 45 minutes to 1 hour.

    * Make filling
    
    1. In medium mixing bowl, stir together ricotta, sugar, chocolate chips, and vanilla. 
    2. Spoon mixture into pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch round tip and refrigerate until ready to use. (Filling can be made up to 1 day ahead and stored, refrigerated, covered.)

    * Form, fry, and fill shells

    1. Cut dough into 4 even pieces. On lightly floured surface, roll out 1 piece to 1/8-inch thick. Using floured cookie cutter, cut out 2 to 3 rounds from dough. 
    2. Transfer rounds to baking sheet and keep covered with plastic wrap. Roll out remaining dough and cut rounds in same manner, then gather scraps, roll out, and cut again.
    3. Fill heavy 4-quart pot with oil to depth of 3 inches. Heat over moderate heat until thermometer registers 375°F.
    4. Meanwhile, brush bottom edge of 1 dough round with egg white. Wrap dough around 1 cannoli tube with egg white–brushed end overlapping other end and gently press edges together to seal. Make 5 more shells in same manner. (Keep remaining rounds covered with plastic.)
    5. Working in 2 batches, fry formed shells in hot oil until deep golden brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to paper towel–lined plate to drain and cool 5 minutes. Stand tubes upright and tap gently against countertop to loosen shells. Twist molds to remove shells.
    6. Wrap remaining dough around tubes and fry in same manner. (Shells may be made 1 day ahead and stored at room temperature, unfilled and uncovered.)
    7. When ready to serve, pipe filling into 1 end of cannoli shell, filling shell halfway, then pipe into other end. Repeat to fill remaining shells. Dust with confectioner’s sugar and serve immediately.
