    1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 
    2. Begin by browning the ground beef, set aside. 
    3. Open all the cans and Slice olives if not already sliced. 
    4. In a 9×13 glass pan lay down enough corn tortillas to cover the bottom one time. 
    5. On top of the tortillas, spread some ground beef to cover the bottom (you can leave some space since there will be two layers). 
    6. Sprinkle corn over the beef so it’s evenly spread. 
    7. Lay sliced olives over the corn so they span the bottom. 
    8. Throw some diced jalapeños across the layer. 
    9. Cover all with cheese. 
    10. Top with Enchilada sauce (1 small can), the sauce doesn’t have to drench, just season. 
    11. Repeat the process adding a layer of tortillas one more time. When finished with your second layer you may have used all of the ground beef, corn and 1 small can of the enchilada sauce. 
    12. For the top layer one final layer of tortillas, top those with cheese, jalapeños, olives and cheese. Finish off with the last can of sauce.
    13. Cover the pan in foil and place in the oven for 30-45 minutes or until you can see bubbles rising in the bottom of the pan from the sauce. 
    14. Pull off the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 so the cheese on top gets crispy. 
    15. Let it cool for 20 min before serving (if you serve before that, serve it in a bowl. It’ll taste great, but it’ll be mushy)

    **ProTips**
    
    1. You can add all sorts of things to this casserole that will be great. Onions with the ground beef, avocados and diced roma tomatoes are good addition. This dish is a lot like pizza, you can add lots of different things to it and it’s almost better reheated from the refrigerator the next day. Hope you like it.
    2. this is also know as enchillada pie. To that end the protein is up for change. chicken, carnitas, vegetarian...doesn't matter, your choice.

This recipe is part of my childhood. Along with Gumbo sandwiches (PB&J premixed in a bowl then spread on bread) and chicken soup. My mom used to make this dish and we’d all be very excited to eat it. I made it for my dad for his last birthday because it’s his favorite meal. Then I married a guy who had never had it. In our first few weeks of marriage I made it for the first time and he thought I was nuts and that all that cheese and sauce couldn’t possibly be that good, but since then he has grown to love this meal and requests it often. Give it a chance…you’ll love it
