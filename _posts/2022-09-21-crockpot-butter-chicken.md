    * 1 (14-ounce) can tomato sauce

    1.  In a nonstick skillet or pot, heat the coconut oil over medium high. Once hot, add the onion and cook until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. 
    2. Add the ginger, garlic, curry, garam masala, chili powder, salt, and tomato paste. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
    3. Transfer the onions to a bowl. 
    4. In the same skillet or pot, cook the chicken until seared on all sides.
    5. Replace onions and spices to the pot. 
    6. Melt the butter in the pot.
    7. Add tomato paste and fry a bit; for 30 sec or so.
    8. Add tomato sauce. Stir to combine all elements into a sauce.
    9. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer the sauce and chicken for 20 min or until chicken is a temp and can be pulled apart with a fork.
    10. Lower the heat to low and let the sauce cool down a bit.
    11. Slowly stir in the coconut mil a bit at a time. 
    12. Stir in the Greek yogurt. (Don't stir in the yogurt if the sauce is still too hot, it will curdle.)
    13. Enjoy warm over brown rice, quinoa, or naan, sprinkled with fresh cilantro.
