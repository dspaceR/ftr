  directions_markdown: |-
    * 1. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
    * 2. Peel and slice the apples and onions. Apples should be thickish, onions should be thin.
    * 3. Mix the salt, pepper and ground cinnamon to create a seasoning and season the tenderloin by rubbing the mix on all sides.
    * 4. Heat the oil in a large skillet or heavy pot that can go in the oven.
    * 5. Sear the pork on all sides; 2 min per side. Remove it from the skillet and set aside.
    * 6. Lower the heat to medium and add 2 Tbs of oil to the skillet. Saute the onions until translucent
    * 7. add the apples and saute for 2 more minutes. Add the cinnamon stick (if using) and sprinkle the brown sugar. Stir
    * 8. Pour the apple cider or juice in to deglaze the pan, stir and remove from the heat
    * 9. Put the tenderloin back in the skillet or pot.
    * 10. bake uncovered in the oven for 20 minutes or until the meat measures 140º
    * 11. Remove from the oven and set pork aside covered for 5 min.
    * 12. while the pork rests, place the butter slices over the apples and let it melt.
    * 13. Serve the sliced pork over the apples and onions.
    **ProTips**
    1. This can be made in the crock pot. Sear the pork, then place it all in and cook on low for 4 hours.
    2. I like to serve this with mashed potatoes and I make a bed.
    3. If you like your apples and onions a little more carmelized, you can seperate the juice and lay the apples and onions on a sheet pan under the broiler for a few minutes.

I found this recipe on a craft beer website. I modified it to not use a pumpkin ale (apple juice/cider substitue). My kids went nuts and loved it so much.  It's a delicious fall and winter recipe.
