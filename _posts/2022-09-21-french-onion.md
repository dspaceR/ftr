    **Follow This Recipe**
    1. Heat a heavy, oven-safe, stock pot over medium-low heat and add the cooking oil once the pot is hot. Melt the butter into the hot oil. 
    2. Stir the sliced onions into the oil/butter mix, ensuring they are evenly coated. Cover the stock pot and cook for around 30 minutes checking to make sure they aren't burning. Onions should be clear and very tender once finished.
    3. Turn up the heat to medium-high, and add the sugar and 1tsp salt.
    4. Continue cooking while stirring until onions are thoroughly browned (caramelized).
    5. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in 3 Tbsp flour. Cook 2-3 minutes until flour forms a thick paste (add more butter if needed). 
    6. Stir in 1 cup of Chicken stock, and stir heavily for a couple seconds.
    7. Add the rest of the stock, sherry, sage, and bay leaf. 
    8. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.
    9. Pre-heat oven to broil. Drizzle both sides of french bread slices with olive oil, and place on a baking sheet. Cook the bread in the oven for 3 minutes on each side watching for burning.
    10. Taste soup, and add salt and pepper as needed, then remove the bay leaf.
    11. When serving, cover the soup mixture with the bread, forming a single layer bread top.
    12. Place a slice of Gruyere over the top of the bread, forming a thick layer. Drizzle melted butter or oil over the cheese, and place the bowl into the oven uncovered. 
    13. Broil for around 3 minutes, or until cheese is melted and browned.
    14. Remove pot from oven and let stand to cool.
     **ProTip**
    1. What a loooong process this is, but it's so worth it.  Be patient, melt those onions alllllll day.
    2. The onions can also be made entirely in a dutch oven.  Follow the same instructions but set the oven to 300ยบ. Stir onions every 20-30 minutes for as long as it takes for those onions to turn translucent and brown.

We love french onion soup but WTF how do you even make those onions sooooooo carmelized!? Time. So much time. I've tried instant pot and crock pot, but for me the old ways are best and I like doing it like this.
