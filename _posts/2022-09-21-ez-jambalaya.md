    1. Begin by starting rice on the stove. (For making rice see here.)
    2. In a large stock pot combine remaining ingredients except for shrimp, tabasco and creole seasoning. 
    3. Set pot on the stove and set burner to high or med-high. 
    4. Allow the pot to boil for about 10 minutes, stirring regularly. 
    5. In the meantime, defrost the shrimp per package instructions. 
    6. After 10 minutes the chicken should be white and cooked almost all the way through. 
    7. Reduce heat to medium and add shrimp. Also add tabasco and creole seasoning to taste. Let it simmer until rice is finished.

    **ProTip**
    1. If you’ve got a lot of time on your hands and an iron or high quality stock pot you can also put this in the oven with a lid (@350) for a few hours (stir occasionally, but be careful, the pot will be hot!). The crock pot also works, but not as well I think. 
    2. You can usually find creole seasoning at your local grocery store. Add a little at a time till you get used to using it. It’s deliciously spicy but it’s also surprisingly salty. Use it sparingly at first; adding a little at a time as you taste.
    3. My kids like this best just with the sausage, I have sold it for years as Hot Dog soup and they love it.

I love Cajun food! The spicier the better. So one day I was craving red beans and rice, so I went to look up a recipe. That’s when I came across a description of Jambalaya. It sounded way better, plus I like protein and it has 4 different kinds. Since I started making the dish, it has been a huge hit, the presentation is impressive (usually a large tray of rice in a circle with the stew in the middle) and no one guesses that it was one of the easiest dinners to make. Give it a try for a party!
