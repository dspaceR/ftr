    1. Combine all ingredients for rub in a bowl.  Ingredients should be in pretty equal amounts except for those marked. Use just a splash of salt (no more than 1 tsp) because bacon will also provide some salt.  
    2. Pre-heat oven to 375.
    3. Unwrap pork chops and pat each dry with a paper towel.  
    4. Add just a dash of olive oil to each pork chop and massage in.  
    5. Rub each pork chop with a generous amount of rub on all sides. Set aside
    6. Slice onion into rounds 1/2″ thick each.
    7. Take one pork chop coated in rub, place onion on top.  
    8. Using toothpicks to secure, wrap Bacon around the chop to secure the onion on.  It may take more than one piece of bacon to wrap entire chop in a spiral.  Repeat with all chops.
    9. Place pork chops in a glass dish or foil lined pan. 
    10. While preheating, set your pork chops in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes to rest.
    11. Place in the oven for bake in oven for 25-30 min. If using the BBQ, Pork chops should be cooked using foil on a grill with medium to medium low heat for 45 min- 1hour or until cooked though.
    12. Pork should be at an internal temp of 160 or until pork is the palest white/pink and moist.  Remove toothpicks before serving (bacon will stay put) and allow meat to rest at least 5 minutes before serving to redistribute juices.

One of my favorites. For a spicy uptick, add minced jalapeno to the rub mixture.
