    **ProTips**
    
    I use extra garlic powder and add onion powder to the mixture. Also we like it extra crunchy on top so I make lots of the cracker crumbs! You can make this ahead of time and freeze it or refrigerate it, it just may need to cook longer.

Jane made this for me after I had both of my children. It is not healthy but it is REALLY good and comforting.
