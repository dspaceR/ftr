    **ProTip**

    This is not a commerial for Trader Joes but, Trader Joes sells portioned pork belly in little packages. I always have 2 in my freezer to pull out for ramen or fried rice. If for some reason you forget to cook the rice the day before, cook the rice day of and spread flat on a cookie sheet and cool in the freezer for 30 min. Sometimes the frozen veggies give off a lot of water, if you want to prevent this, in a small skillet heat the frozen veggies; drain and then add to the big pan.

That guy I married loves fried rice. I love rice. I also do the cooking and am *terrible* at portioning rice so I always have extra. This recipe is a win win (win).
