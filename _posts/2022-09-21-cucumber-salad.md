    **Follow This Recipe**
    1. In a small bowl, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, and salt. Set the dressing aside to give it time to blend.
    2. Peel and slice the cucumber using your favorite method (see photos below for my technique).
    Place the sliced cucumbers in a large bowl.
    3. Slice the green onions.
    4. Add the dressing, and green onions to the sliced cucumbers. Stir to combine. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat. Give the salad a brief stir before serving to redistribute the dressing and flavors.
    **ProTips**
    1. The longer it's in the fridge before serving the better.
    2. It's easy to scale this up, but I make a small amount to make sure we eat it all.

I've had a cucumber salad like this at many restaurants and it's always so fresh and light.  I love it.
